    - subject: Generate one image with all display controllers
- commits:
    - body: |-
        Avoid creating individual images for each display
        controller and instead just create one image and require
        that FBCP_DISPLAY is set.
        This commit also includes support for the `dtoverlay`
        display controller which is just the generic rpi-fbcp
        that requires `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay` for drivers.
